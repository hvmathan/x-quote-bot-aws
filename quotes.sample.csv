quote
Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
Small steps every day add up to big changes.
Your future needs you—your past doesn’t.
Breathe. This moment is enough.
Progress, not perfection.
You don’t have to see the whole staircase—just take the next step.
Be kind to yourself; you’re learning.
Consistency beats intensity when it’s done daily.
One good decision today can change your tomorrow.
You are capable of more than you think.
